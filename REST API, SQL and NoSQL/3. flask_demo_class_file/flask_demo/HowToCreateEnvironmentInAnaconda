Step 1: Create a new environment using Anaconda prompt
        conda create -n env_name python==3.6.9   (Mentioning a python version is optional)
                                                  But always a good practice
        Check all environments list which we have created so far using anaconda
                conda env list
        Activate the newly created environment in Anaconda prompt
             conda activate env_name

Create requirements file
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

Install the requirements from requirements.txt file
    pip install -r path-for-requirements.txt file
